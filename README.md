UInt256
=======
A 256 bit unsigned integer struct for Swift.

Part of the [CryptoCoinSwift](https://github.com/CryptoCoinSwift/CryptoCoinFramework) framework, but it can be used independently.

Tests are based on [Bigi](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/bigi/blob/master/test/bigi.js) from CryptoCoinJS, but without its variable length.

Take a look at the [playground](UInt256 documentation.playground/section-1.swift) to see what it can do.
